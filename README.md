# Threshold Photoelectron Spectrum of Cyclobutadiene

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the poster **“Threshold Photoelectron Spectrum of Cyclobutadiene: Comparison with Time-Dependent Wave Packet Simulations”**, presented by **April Zeng, Jimmy Zheng, and Sherry Zhao** from the **Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL)**.

The project reinvestigates the photoionization and vibronic coupling behavior of **cyclobutadiene (C₄H₄)** — a prototypical *antiaromatic* molecule — using **mass-selected threshold photoelectron spectroscopy (ms-TPEs)** and **time-dependent wave packet simulations**.

---

## 🔬 Background
Cyclobutadiene (CBD) is the smallest and most studied example of an **antiaromatic** molecule, characterized by 4π delocalized electrons that destabilize the ring structure. This unique instability gives rise to rich vibronic coupling and Jahn–Teller distortions observable in its electronic spectra.

---

## ⚗️ Methodology
- **Experimental technique:**  
  Mass-selected Photoelectron–Photoion Coincidence Spectroscopy (**PEPICO**) was used to record **ms-TPE spectra**, minimizing contamination from reactive intermediates.

- **Simulation approach:**  
  Time-dependent **wavepacket dynamics** were performed using a **vibronic coupling model Hamiltonian**, parametrized with **CASPT2** (Complete Active Space with Second-Order Perturbation Theory) calculations.

---

## 📈 Results
- The **adiabatic ionization energy (IE)** of cyclobutadiene was determined to be **8.06 ± 0.02 eV**, in close agreement with simulations.
- The dominant vibrational contribution in the spectrum arises from the **ν₄ mode**, coupled to **ν₁** and **ν₅** vibrations due to **Jahn–Teller distortions**.
- Theoretical and experimental spectra show excellent consistency, validating the CASPT2-based vibronic coupling model.

---

## 🧠 Interpretation
- The **neutral** and **cationic** forms of CBD exhibit strong **pseudo-Jahn–Teller** and **Jahn–Teller** interactions, respectively.
- The **ν₄ vibration** mediates transitions between rectangular **D₂h** minima and a square **D₄h** transition state, defining the molecule’s dynamic behavior upon ionization.
